Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create my own diagnostic app that can help individuals figure out if they have tension-type headaches or migraines based on a series of question that define characteristics of either tension-type headaches or migraines.
 
Known Issues:
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
